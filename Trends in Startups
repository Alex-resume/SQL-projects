FROM startups
;

-- 8. Average value per catagory

FROM startups
GROUP BY category
;

-- 9. Rounding
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
;

-- 10. Sort by Descending
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) DESC
;
-- Use column names instead of column numbers for readability

-- 11. Count by catagory
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
;

-- 12. Filter by catagory
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
;

-- 13. Average by catagory, sort by ascending
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY AVG(employees) ASC
;
-- Use column names instead of column numbers for readability
